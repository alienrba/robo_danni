# robo_danni
This project is about my master class in robotics, which i lost it and now i am building it all over again

So, long story short, i had to publish and present my project on 13th February 2021 and four days prior to this, i lost almost all of my data due to a hard disk failure. Of course this project had to be on the "missing in action" files and folders list...

I presented a much lesser project and got a much lesser grade (as expected) so i will build it again in order to restore my dignity (and i think it will be fun).
